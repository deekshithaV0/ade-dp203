Day19-Monitoring & Optimizing

I have been working on monitoring and troubleshooting across Azure Services.I worked with Azure monitor to see resource level data for ADLS and Data factory.I was able to comprehend the behavior of throughput,latency and request counts during pipeline runs.In order to ensure that the proper people are informed when problems arise.I set up the email notifications and action groups after creating alert rules in azure data pipeline failures,duration thresholds and also trigger failures as well and i understood that ADF runtime automatically adjusts according to the pipeline load which is crucial for effectively managing large voulme of ETL batches and high frequency workloads i looked into ADF's built in troubleshooting tools and learned how to evaluate pipeline run history,activity level error messages and integration runtime health and the output and error tabs provide incredibly detailed insights that aid in immediate failure correction.i also covered monitoring options inside the synapse workspace to check query performance,pipeline runs and SQL pool status which is critical for diagnosing production workloads. and i learnt syanpse system views to check active sessions and ongoing queries and resource usage which helps optimize performance and identify workload trends in real time.
