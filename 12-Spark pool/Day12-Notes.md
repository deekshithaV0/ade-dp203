Day12- Azure Synapse Spark Pool 

I understand how spark pool is inside synapse like basically a scalable cluster used to execute distributed data processing and understood how spark uses distributed computing across executors to parallelize data transformations for instance when processing a large dataset spark split the work across multiple executors running on different nodes which makes processing much faster than doing it on a single machine and i created my own spark pool inside azure synapse workspace and i learnt different configuration options like node size autoscale settings to automatically adjust the number of nodes based on the workload and the number os executors and also looked at memory and core configurations to understand how resources are allocated across the cluster.
