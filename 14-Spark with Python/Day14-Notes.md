Day14- Spark with Python -Datatypes,collections,DataFrames

I learnt python data types like string,int,float,boolean,list,dict and tuple since most of the spark transformations require working with some of the python variables before creating the data frames and i understood how list store multiple values and worked with simple list operations in notebooks and lists are often used to prepare data before loading into spark.then i moved to pyspark and created dataframes using python dictionaries and lists and i learnt dataframe operations like select,filter and show and understand the spark dataframes work like SQL tables but run distributed across multiple nodes and i also understood and worked on loading data from files like csv,json into pyspark dataframes and observed how spark can automatically infer the schema or need to specify it manually which is really useful depending upon the data.
