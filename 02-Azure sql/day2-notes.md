Day 2- Azure SQLdatabase

I learned about Azure Sql database . I understand how it is different from a SQL server instaled on VM.I started my first Azure SQL database on the portal and installed  Azure Data Studio to run SQL queries.I connected my sql datbase from Azure Data Studio and just started running queries like SELECT to pull data, where  to filter things down,ORDER BY to sort things and GROUp BY to organize it,also worked with aggregrate funcions like COUNT,SUM and AVG.
