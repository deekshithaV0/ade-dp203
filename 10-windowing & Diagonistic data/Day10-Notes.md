Day10-windowing & Diagonistic data 

I learnt about windowing functions and how they group streaming data based on time intervals and mainly i focused on tumbling windows which are fixed and over lapping the time periods that helps to process the data in pieces  and setup these up and implementing them in some real trime aggregrations which are really useful to see.Then i understood  that stream analytics  can run multiple queries at the same time when you need take one stream and process it into different outputs for different puposes and i also learnt reference data and how we can use it to improve your streaming events with slow changing informations . Foe instance when we join in live transaction stream with a lookup table to add more context for each event.I learnt all of this because i wanted to understand how to handle time based aggregrations properly in streaming scenarios and how to make streaming data more meaningful to improve it with some more informations.
