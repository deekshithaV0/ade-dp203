Day17- Azure Synapse & Storage security 

I have been studying security and governance features across azure synapse and Databricks .I understood that by using column level sevcurity i can restrict access to particular columns like showing employee names but hiding the salaries.I also looked into row level security which would be helpful in situations where sales manager should only see data from their region and rls controls which rows people can view based on their identity and it would be helpful in situations where a sales manager should only view data specific to their area in order to partially hide sensitive information for instance such as changing kevin@gmail.com to k****@gmail.com for users without full access i worked with data masking.I learnt about synapse encryption including how workspace encryption safeguards metadata and how transparent data encryption encrypts data at rest in dedicated SQL pools.I created users assigned responsibilities and setup administrators to practice microsoft EntraID integration.my understandings of access control models are RBAC for resource level access and ACL  for delicate file and directory permissions in ADLS and i also looked at storage networking with VNet integration severice endpoints and firewall rules by building a virtual machine to verify secure access and i worked with SAS tokens for time bound temporary access.i learnt about managed identities which allow services like ADF and synapse to access ADLS without the need for keys or passwords because azure manages the credentials on its own in synapse which automatically labels sensitive data finally i setup databricks secret scope to securely store credentials,keys and connection strings then used those secrets in notebooks rather than hardcoding passwords which is how production pipelines handle security.
