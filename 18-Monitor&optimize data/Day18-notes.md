Day 18- Montior & Optimize data 

I have been learning more about ADLS Gen2 best practices and working with microsoft purview.I understood that purview is a data governance application that facilitates lineage tracking and classification throughout entire data estate. setup a purview accouny through the portal set up collections to arrange assets and turned on ADF synapse and ADLS scanning.purview automatically recognized file formats like CSV,Parquet and JSON when i merged it with Azure Data Lake Gen2 using a managed identity and scanned containers.I connected ADF Pipelines to visualize the entire data flow from source to transform to sink and i connected synapse SQL pools to purview to enable table lineage and schema extraction.The main advantage is that purview makes governance much easier by providing with an overview of any and all information assets throughout the company.using a medallion architecture,arranging data by year,month,and day for easier partitioning and permitting hierarchical namespace for folder level operations are some of the ADLS Gen2 best practices. I understood about access tiers hot for frequently accessed data with best performance but highesr cost,cool for infrequent access with lower storagecosts and archive for rarely accessed data that's very cheap but slow to retrieve.i even set up lifecycle management rules to automatically move files between tiers based on when they were last modified which helps optimize storage costs without manual involvement.
